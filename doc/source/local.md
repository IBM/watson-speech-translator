# Run locally

This document shows how to run the `watson-speech-translator` application on your local machine.

## Steps

1. [Clone the repo](#clone-the-repo)
1. [Configure credentials](#configure-credentials)
1. [Start the server](#start-the-server)

### Clone the repo

Clone `watson-speech-translator` locally. In a terminal, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/watson-speech-translator
cd watson-speech-translator
```

### Configure credentials

Copy the **watson-language-translator/env.sample** file to **watson-language-translator/.env**.

```bash
cp env.sample .env
```

Edit the **.env** file to configure credentials before starting the Node.js server.
The credentials to configure will depend on whether you are provisioning services using IBM Cloud Pak for Data or on IBM Cloud.

<details><summary><b>IBM Cloud Pak for Data</b></summary>
<p>

For each service (<b>SPEECH_TO_TEXT, LANGUAGE_TRANSLATOR, and TEXT_TO_SPEECH</b>) the following settings are needed with the service name as a prefix:

* Set <b>_AUTH_TYPE</b> to <b>cp4d</b>
* Provide the <b>_URL</b>, <b>_USERNAME</b> and <b>_PASSWORD</b> collected in the previous step.
* For the <b>_AUTH_URL</b> use the base fragment of your URL including the host and port. <i>I.e. https://{cpd_cluster_host}{:port}</i>.
* If your CPD installation is using a self-signed certificate, you need to disable SSL verification with both <b>_AUTH_DISABLE_SSL</b> and <b>_DISABLE_SSL</b>. Disable SSL only if absolutely necessary, and take steps to enable SSL as soon as possible.
* Make sure the examples for IBM Cloud and bearer token auth are commented out (or removed).
